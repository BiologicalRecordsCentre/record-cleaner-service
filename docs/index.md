The Record Cleaner service exists to validate and verify biological records
against a set of rules.

The API is, to a large extent, self-documenting thanks to 
[Swagger UI](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui). It presents an
interactive interface where you can exercise the API from a browser. This is 
located at {base_url}/docs.

The documentation here fills in some additional detail you might want.
