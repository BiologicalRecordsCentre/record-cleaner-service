## [3.0.0]

### Added
 - organism_key to Taxon table which is then included in responses from 
   /species/taxon_by_tvk and /species/taxon_by_name.
 - organism_key to response from /verify
 - End point /rules/additional/organism_key/{organism_key}
 - End point /rules/difficulty/organism_key/{organism_key}
 - End point /rules/period/organism_key/{organism_key}
 - End point /rules/phenology/organism_key/{organism_key}
 - End point /rules/tenkm/organism_key/{organism_key}

### Changed
 - Python module requirements to latest versions.
 - Rules to be referenced by organism key rather than taxon version key.
   Consequently this changes the response from 
    - /rules/additional/org_group/{org_group_id} 
    - /rules/difficulty/org_group/{org_group_id} 
    - /rules/period/org_group/{org_group_id} 
    - /rules/phenology/org_group/{org_group_id} 
    - /rules/tenkm/org_group/{org_group_id} 

### Fixed
 - Exception when Indicia API returned a JSON error.

- result to /verify and /validate response. This contains a string of
  ['pass'|'warn'|'fail'].

### Changed
- /validate and /verify to raise errors on taxon name/tvk of ''.
- /validate to always returns sref.gridref.
- /validate to return vc assignment if vc not provided.
- /rules/update_result to have progress indicator, rules_updating_now.
- /verify id_difficulty to be an integer rather than a list. The highest value 
  rather than all values.
